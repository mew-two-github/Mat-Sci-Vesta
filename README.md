Apart from the theoritical questions, contains the following operations in Vesta(and associated data manipulations):
* Part-1 Basics (Question-1):
  1. Hiding longer bonds
  2. Ball and Stick & Polyhedral Modes
  3. Identifying the Unit Cell
  4. Generating planes and identifying atoms
  5. Generating family of planes
  6. Identifying cell parameters, bond distances and bond lengths
* Part-2 X-Ray Diffraction (Question-4):
  1. Generating XRD data
  2. Computing hkl associated with each peak from generated XRD data
  3. Computing parameters a (and also d<sub>hkl</sub>) from XRD
  4. Comparison with experimental XRD
